Since there are few reviews specifically introducing the development of 3DGS in the field of autonomous driving, and most 3DGS reviews devote a small section to introducing the application or development direction of 3DGS in autonomous driving. Therefore, we only made a simple distinction when summarizing these surveys, adding a star ⭐ before the reviews targeting the field of autonomous driving.
