* 🔗 **Link**：\[[arXiv:2407.02598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02598)]
* 📖 **Introduction**：This paper proposes AutoSplat to achieve highly realistic reconstruction of autonomous driving scenes. It decomposes the background and imposes geometric constraints on its road and sky regions to enable multi-view consistent rasterization. It uses 3D templates to initialize foreground Gaussians and combines reflection Gaussian consistency constraints to reconstruct invisible parts from symmetric visible views. It captures the dynamic visual features of foreground objects by estimating time-dependent residual spherical harmonics. AutoSplat outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis across various driving scenarios.

* 🔗 **Link**：\[[arXiv:2401.01339](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01339)]
* 📖 **Introduction**：The dynamic urban scenes of Street Gaussians are represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic logic and 3D Gaussians, each of which is associated with either a foreground vehicle or the background. To model the dynamics of foreground objects, each object point cloud is optimized using an optimizable tracking pose and a 4D spherical harmonic model for dynamic appearance. Street Gaussians enable scene editing operations and rendering at 135 FPS (1066 x 1600 resolution) within half an hour after training.
