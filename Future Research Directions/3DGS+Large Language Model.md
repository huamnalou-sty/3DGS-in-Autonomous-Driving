* 🔗 **Link**：\[[arXiv:2311.16037](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16037)]
* 🤔 **Challenge**：Performing fine-grained local editing on 3D scenes using only short text instructions is very difficult because computers struggle to accurately map text to specific Regions of Interest (RoI) in 3D, often leading to incorrect edit ranges or background damage.
* 📖 **Introduction**：GaussianEditor proposes a systematic editing framework that explicitly introduces an LLM Assistant to enhance controllability. First, the LLM analyzes user text instructions to extract a precise target region (Text RoI); then, the system uses visual grounding techniques to align the Text RoI into 3D Gaussian space (Gaussian RoI); finally, combining diffusion model priors, it refines only the Gaussians in the target area.

It combines the explicit scene representation provided by 3D Gaussian Splatting, allowing the LLM to directly "reason" and "locate" within 3D space. This method can handle open-vocabulary queries without retraining, significantly improving a robot's ability to understand user instructions and locate target objects in unknown environments.
