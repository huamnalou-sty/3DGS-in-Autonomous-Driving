\## 📝 Abstract



With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, the understanding and interaction of the driving environment, as a core component, has increasingly higher requirements for real-time performance and accuracy. \*\*3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\*\*, as an efficient 3D scene reconstruction method, features real-time rendering, high-fidelity reconstruction, and flexible editing capabilities. It can significantly enhance the accuracy of perception, planning, and decision-making, and is gradually replacing implicit reconstruction methods represented by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).



This paper categorizes and discusses four major application areas of 3DGS in autonomous driving: \*\*Scene Reconstruction, Scene Editing, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and Autonomous Driving Simulation\*\*. Finally, we analyze the challenges faced by 3DGS in autonomous driving applications and explore future research directions.
